Hello! As mentioned on here earlier, I will be starting a semester-long personal project to build a custom Linux OS from scratch, albeit on top of an existing host system (since I can't freely build a system on top of nothing to boot on in the first place). I'm aiming to have a lightweight and working system in an `.iso` file as well as the filesystem hosted in the repo for reference. I will also most likely be writing up documentation in the wiki for this project at the end of development, which should be fun since I have a knack for liking to write things extensively.

I have put together a [brief write-up](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o2b0ccarh5vt68h/NoodlOS.docx?dl=0) of the specs of what I'll be expecting myself to implement and complete in a matter of 10 weeks. Check it out, and on that note, I'll be keeping this series posted with how my progress is and future simplified guides!
