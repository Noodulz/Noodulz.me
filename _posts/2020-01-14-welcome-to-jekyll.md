# Welcome to Jekyll! (Or How I Spent 7 Ungodly Hours Building this Site with Jekyll)
Let me start off by saying that for those who are still learning web development, programming, or still feel like a fresh young new baby when it comes to the world of CS and web dev: It's okay to have 20 tabs open full of command cheatsheets and tutorials because you're often forgetful. It's okay to have those 20+ tabs take up the majority of your RAM and heat up whatever surface you're on. Don't listen to those pish posh people saying those bunches of open tabs out in the wild give them anxiety (I love you Insom, whatever your name is in real life). We are all still learning, and prone to mistakes and forgetfulness, so take pride in that, y'all. 

In fact, I have just finished this site at 12:30 am on a Wednesday dusk and have decided against studying for my Kanji quiz (yet) for my test in 9 hours, and instead write this before I slave away to the calls of the engineering student grind. 

Why? It's to start building a habit of documenting my progress in building things, projects, especially since starting this semester I have a bit of an internship project to complete that involves just that. And plus, it's great practice to document and write down every thought process, much like the practice of commenting your code (though not every single line, or train of thought in this case). 

Now, this all started with sneaking a peek the other day at a few of my friends' Github pages with their hippy cool tutorials on Digital Ocean and binary exploitation. All that fun hippy jazz. It was neat. Accessible. But most of all, very appealing and interesting.. So I thought, why not do the same? Now of course, I could've just resorted to having Github Pages do everything for me and add folders for pages as needed (in fact I literally realized this right after I finished this website! Hurrah!). But. But! I simply wanted the challenge. The challenge thrills me. It awakens and beats up the ADHD in me and gets me to focus intensely on doing nothing else but building this website that I need to get rid of the thrilling itch for.

And so, I rushed to the public library and read for 2 hours on the documentation and tutorials for Github Pages and then the documentation for Jekyll, as well as the numerous themes that I could now choose from. Then it was just reading [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) after [tutorial](https://michelleful.github.io/code-blog//2014/02/28/setting-up-a-jekyll-blog-on-github-pages/) after [tutorial](https://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) to kind of get it in my head what I need to do and remember. And then the magic begins.

At first, I was lost between following two different resources telling me different things to do to build jekyll and the website locally. Don't do this. Stick to one thing or one resource only for specific major steps. There's a plethora of resources out there that I'm constantly overwhelmed by. Really listen to people when they say just stick to one resource and branch off from there as needed. Continuing on that note, I was simultaneously following two guides at once and eventually had the server built and the templates generated. And in addition, with switching between [Git references](https://githowto.com/staging_changes) and such, I managed to learn more Git in an hour than I did in a week module in last semester's Java programming class. Repetition, baby.
