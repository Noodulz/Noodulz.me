Lately I've spent this summer aimlessly flipping through PDFs of guides on programming and exploitation as well as diving into (what is probably my 5th time) CS50 to revisit the basics and learn the foundation needed to break into this mysterious field. After watching countless videos and reading hundreds of articles every night, though, I find myself getting distracted and off track jumping from resource to resource and book to article, barely getting anywhere. 
<br/>
So after all that time spent, here I'll lay out a structured guide of resources and websites to keep me on track to where I need to be to get to a point of understanding CTFs and overall application security better. Hopefully it may reach some of you guys who may also be bitterly prone to distractions and hopping from guide to guide.
