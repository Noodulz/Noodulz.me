A static blog built with Jekyll and Github pages. Will be publishing dev progress, future write-ups, tutorials as I learn along in infosec and exploitation, and some thoughts and more! 

Blog will be updated consistently and constantly with new additions and UI as we go along. Documentation for how to utilize this structure to implement on your own site will also be done soon. Stay tuned!
