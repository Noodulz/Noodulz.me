# Eldoon
* A Reddit web scraper written in Python using the Praw and Pandas modules. Scrapes a user's saved posts and comments and appends them to .csv files accordingly for reference. Small script that may be used in a future project. Users will need to provide their own client tokens via making an app in reddit in their login pages and fill it out in main.py<br/>
