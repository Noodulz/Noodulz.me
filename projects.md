# Eldoon
* A Reddit web scraper written in Python using the Praw and Pandas modules. Scrapes a user's saved posts and comments and appends them to .csv files accordingly for reference. Small script that may be used in a future project. Users will need to provide their own client tokens via [making an app](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) in Reddit in their login pages and fill it out in main.py.<br/>

# Udon Know Me
* A Python terminal application with a minimal GUI that lets you scan for open ports of a given host, as well as obtain the IP address of the host. Note that this is a POC (proof-of-concept) network scanner and is not meant to be taken so seriously, but it functions and does its job. Please don't use this on other people's websites. Set up your own server or use www.hackthissite.org for reference! <br/>
