I'll just state here that I'm planning to work on a Linux systems project built on top of Debian, and that I'll keep this page updated with more relevant projects and contributions I've contributed to. Otherwise, check out my [Github](github.com/noodulz) for the rest of my gists and little stuff I built so far.<br/>
